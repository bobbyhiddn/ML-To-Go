# Week 3: Classical Machine Learning

## Learning Objectives
- Build document classifiers using classical ML algorithms
- Understand SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics

## Topics Covered
- Classification algorithms (SVM, RF, NB, Logistic Regression)
- Train-test splitting and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Exercises
1. Train multiple classifiers on document data
2. Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
3. Compare model performance
4. Analyze confusion matrices and classification reports
