# Experiments

This directory is for storing experiment outputs, model checkpoints, and training logs.

## Structure
- `runs/` - Training runs and experiments
- `outputs/` - Model outputs and predictions
- `*.log` - Training and experiment logs

## Usage
Use this folder to organize different experimental configurations and track results.
Each experiment should be clearly documented with:
- Experiment name and date
- Model architecture and hyperparameters
- Dataset used
- Results and metrics

## Note
Model files and large outputs are ignored by git. Use experiment tracking tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases for better experiment management.
