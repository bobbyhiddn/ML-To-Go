## Overview
Package your model for cloud deployment with Docker and AWS SageMaker.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up AWS account and IAM roles
- Containerize ML models with Docker
- Write SageMaker inference scripts
- Test containers locally

## Notebooks
1. `01_aws_setup.ipynb`
2. `02_containerize_model.ipynb`
3. `03_local_to_cloud.ipynb`

## Key Components
- `docker/Dockerfile`
- `docker/serve.py`
- `docker/requirements.txt`

## Deliverable
Working Docker container that runs locally and can deploy to SageMaker.

## Time Estimate
