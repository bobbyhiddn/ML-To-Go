# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration, experimentation, and tutorials.

## Organization
Organize notebooks by week or topic:
- `week1_*.ipynb` - Week 1 notebooks
- `week2_*.ipynb` - Week 2 notebooks
- etc.

## Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include markdown cells explaining your work
- Clear outputs before committing (use nbstripout)
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic
- Use version control for code, not for outputs

## Running Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
or
```bash
jupyter lab
```

The development container is configured to forward port 8888 for Jupyter access.
