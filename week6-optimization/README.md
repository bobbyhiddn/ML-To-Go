# Week 6: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Make your classifier faster and more memory efficient.

## Learning Objectives
- Quantize models for faster inference
- Implement batch processing
- Add caching and deduplication
- Benchmark performance improvements

## Notebooks
1. `01_model_quantization.ipynb`
2. `02_batch_processing.ipynb`
3. `03_caching_strategies.ipynb`
4. `04_performance_benchmarks.ipynb`

## Deliverable
Achieve 2x speed improvement from Week 5.

## Time Estimate
~18 hours
